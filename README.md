I conducted an empirical analysis on economic growth, utilizing a cross-country dataset featuring specific economic indicators from 1990 and 2015.My work involved summarizing the data through statistical analysis, where I examined relationships between variables such as GDP per capita and the savings rate. I also explored concepts like convergence, comparing results across the two time periods and considering the impact of variables such as schooling and population growth on economic outcomes.

I first investigated developmental accounting using the cross-country dataset from previous homework. I explored how savings rates, human capital, and technology influence living standards relative to the U.S. by constructing and analyzing the relationship between technology and living standards, with a special focus on China's technological improvements from 1990 to 2015. Then, I delved into an endogenous growth model without capital, analyzing the effects of labor allocation to idea production on the growth rate of technology and output per worker. I investigated the model's steady-state growth rate and how technological growth and the level of technology are impacted by changes in parameters like the fraction of labor devoted to new ideas. Additionally, I analyzed household savings and consumption decisions over two periods, particularly examining how interest rates and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution influence consumption choices, drawing on the effects of changes in the interest rate and the savings behavior on first- and second-period consumption.
